The **Ventilator project** is developed at UPC Manresa. It is project
commited to achieve a serious *open and free design* for a
[ventilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator) unit. The
design includes:
 
  * the mechanics, 
  * the hardware, 
  * the software and,
  * the documentation

The aim is to get a flexible enough design that allows for a number of
simple implementations that can be choosed depending on the actual
context were they should be used.
